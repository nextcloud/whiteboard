# Storage strategy for whiteboard data and socket-related temporary data
# Valid values are: 'redis' or 'lru' (Least Recently Used cache)
# This strategy is used for:
#  1. Whiteboard data storage
#  2. Socket-related temporary data (e.g., cached tokens, bound data for each socket ID)
#  3. Scaling the socket server across multiple nodes (when using 'redis')
# We strongly recommend using 'redis' for production environments
# 'lru' provides a balance of performance and memory usage for single-node setups
STORAGE_STRATEGY=lru

# Redis connection URL for data storage and socket server scaling
# Required when STORAGE_STRATEGY is set to 'redis'
# This URL is used for both persistent data and temporary socket-related data
# Format: redis://[username:password@]host[:port][/database_number]
# Example: redis://user:password@redis.example.com:6379/0
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
